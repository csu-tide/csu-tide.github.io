# Usage Guidelines

## Data Storage
All users start with **50 GB of storage** within the CSU TIDE JupyterHub ([see campus-specific information otherwise](/jupyterhub/gettingaccess#campus-specific-access)). Users are responsible for managing the storage they've been allocated including deletion of large, unused, and/or temporary files *(e.g. ML model checkpoints, old git repos, virtual environments)*.

**If users require more storage** than the default amount, please check out the [Storage Services](/storage-services/) section.

{: .note }
**Disclaimer**: TIDE currently has no storage that is suitable for HIPAA, PID, FISMA, FERPA, CSU Protected Level-1, or protected data of any kind. Users are not permitted to store such data on TIDE machines.
