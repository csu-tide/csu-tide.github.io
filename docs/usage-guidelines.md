# Usage Guidelines

{: .note }
**Disclaimer**: The National Research Platform currently has no storage that is suitable for HIPAA, PID, FISMA, FERPA, or protected data of any kind. Users are not permitted to store such data on NRP machines.

## Data Storage
All users start with **50 GB of storage** within JupyterHub. Users are responsible for managing the storage they've been allocated including deletion of large, unused, and/or temporary files *(e.g. ML model checkpoints, old git repos, virtual environments)*.

**If users require more storage** than the default amount, please contact [TIDE Support](https://tide.sdsu.edu/contact/) for further assistance.

## NRP Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
**All new users** must accept the [AUP Policy](https://docs.nrp.ai/assets/NRP-AUP.pdf) in order to access the TIDE cluster by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the [Nautilus Portal](https://portal.nrp-nautilus.io/)
1. Login with CILogon (top-right)
1. Accept the AUP policy from the home page

## NRP Attribution
In addition to the above mentioned guidelines for usage of the TIDE cluster, all users must abide by NRP's guidelines and restrictions stated in the Nautilus [documentation](https://ucsd-prp.gitlab.io/userdocs/start/policies/).
