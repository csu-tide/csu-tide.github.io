TIDE is available for research use across the CSU system. To get access, please review [Using TIDE](https://tide.sdsu.edu/usingtide/) and submit a TIDE Support Request to be granted access to JupyterHub.

Once a support request is submitted and reviweed, a member of the TIDE team will reach out with next-steps to complete the set up. Refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) once this process is completed.
