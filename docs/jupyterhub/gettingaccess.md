# Getting Access

TIDE is available for research use across the CSU system. To get access, please complete the [TIDE Contact Us form](https://tide.sdsu.edu/contact/){:target="_blank"}.

Once the form is received, a member of the TIDE team will reach out with next-steps to complete the set up. Refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) once this process is completed.
