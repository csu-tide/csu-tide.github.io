# Getting Access

TIDE is available for research use across the CSU system. To get access, please navigate to the support form in [Using TIDE](https://tide.sdsu.edu/usingtide/){:target="_blank"}.

Once a support form is submitted and received, a member of the TIDE team will reach out with next-steps to complete the set up. Refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) once this process is completed.
