## JupyterHub

JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

You are allocated 50 GB (gigabytes) of JupyterHub storage. If you need additional space, please sumbit a [TIDE Support Request](https://tide.sdsu.edu/tide-support-request/){:target="_blank"}. To check your storage in use, refer to the [Check Disk Quota](faqs/diskquota) FAQ.
