Available images process:

- All links must have target=_blank

Software column:
- Parent container
- Anything not a package (VS Code)
- Packages/cli tools should be in alphabetical order
  - No line breaks per package here

Convert packages list to markdown prompt:
can you give me this list in alphabetical order with markdown bold using __ __, <br/> line breaks in between, following the case of the input. These elements are entered into a table so I'll need them all on one line. I'll need it in raw format so I can copy and paste easily

Proposed next steps:
- Move non-python packages to below the parent container in the software column
- Replace line breaks in packages section with spaces
- Graphs
