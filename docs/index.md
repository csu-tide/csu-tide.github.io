# Overview

[Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE)](https://tide.sdsu.edu/){:target="_blank"} provides CSU researchers with free access to research-class CPU & GPU resources and was built with a focus on AI and machine learning. 
While AI and machine learning workflows are the focus of TIDE, they are not a requirement, meaning that other workloads amenable to containerization are welcome.

For the latest updates, check out the [TIDE timeline](https://tide.sdsu.edu/timeline/){:target="_blank"}.

## JupyterHub
TIDE offers a dedicated JupyterHub instance that offers simplified access to TIDE resources in a browser-based development environment.
JupyterHub is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 
Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.
Languages such as Python, R, and Julia are available along with Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow libraries.

## Batch Jobs
In addition to the JupyterHub instance, batch jobs can be created and run as software containers directly on the TIDE cluster.
Batch jobs allow for longer running jobs as well as parallelization of jobs.

*TIDE is funded by [NSF Award #2346701](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2346701).
TIDE is integrated with the [National Research Platform](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/).*
